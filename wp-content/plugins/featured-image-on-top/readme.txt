Tired of having to move your "Featured Images" metabox to the top?  I've got a fix for that!

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

== Screenshots ==
1. The post screen showing the metabox up in the top right.  Not really that fancy.

2. The only option in the plugin.  It can force all users to keep the metabox up to, despite how they order their metaboxes.

== Description ==

It may be my personal preference, but I really like having the "Featured Image" metabox up at the top of my screen.  I use it almost first thing on every post I write, so I don't like searching for it.  This plugin will force that metabox on top for the "post" post type.
There's only one option available, in the regular *Media Settings* page.  "Allow Users to Customize Order" which is ON by default, can force users (if off) to have their "Featured Image" metabox stuck to the top.
